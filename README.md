# Engineering Decision Log Backend System

A backend application built to record, track, and explain technical or organizational decisions over time.
The system focuses on **decision traceability**, helping teams understand *why* a decision was taken,
what alternatives were considered, and what outcome followed.

This project is intentionally backend-focused, emphasizing clean architecture, readable code,
and explainable business logic.
